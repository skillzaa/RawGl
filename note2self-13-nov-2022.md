I have learnt webGl to some extend BUT

I don not have to write my own frameWork in the first year. That may come if needed. 
I am spending much of my time in solving problems which have already been solved 

- I needed this low level introduction and 1 year or wroking with canvas to learn how it works but now 

I MUST MOGRATE TO INDUSTRY STANDERD LIBRARIES LIKE THREE.JS AND PIXI.JS AND WORK ON MY APP RATHER THAN ON A LIBRARY.
