    <h1>Asset Builder Version Zero</h1>

<p>The Concept of Assets Module:</p>    
<ol>
    <li>We have simple shapes (called primtives) for example rectangle, triangle etc. We can compose larger images and assets from these smaller shapes. The AssetBuilder object help us in creating assets.</li>
    <li>The second purpose of assets module is to provide ready to consume assets.</li>
    <li>Every asset has x , y , width and height.</li>
    <li>Other than this it has a pallete. The user can use this pallate.</li>
</ol>

<p>The AssetCollection class has static functions which will return an asset builder object. We can change its properties and then extract an asset out of it.</p>
